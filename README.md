# Market-Dominance-Analytics-through-Sales-Projections-Power-BI

As a Business Data Analyst at CBR, I spearheaded the development of a Power BI dashboard for dynamic monitoring of monthly revenue and units sold across U.S. regions. This initiative aimed at facilitating precise sales forecasting, uncovering key market insights.

The dashboard revealed that California emerged as the highest revenue contributor, underlining its significant impact on overall sales. Further analysis identified 'House Blend' as the top revenue-generating product, boasting the most units sold at a price of $13.75 per unit.

Through this project, I played a pivotal role in providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making, ensuring a data-driven approach to market dominance and revenue optimization.
